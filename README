This is a project to make it possible to use LyX [0], a WYSIWYM [1]
editor based on LaTeX, to edit Internet-Drafts (and, if the RFC-Editor
ever wanted to, RFCs).  It works by converting LyX documents to
xml2rfc's XML schema, then applying xml2rfc and/or the Greenbytes
XSL template.

Currently the project is quite functional, though not every xml2rfc
feature is supported (e.g., iref is missing).  It consists of an XSLT 2.0
template to convert LyX XHTML output to the xml2rfc schema, at which
point the xml2rfc tool is run to typeset in any of the normal I-D/RFC
formats (text, HTML, and PDF).  The lyx2rfc script automates all of this
work.

In order to use this one must add the custom inset definitions from the
custom_insets file.  These custom insets are used to handle metadata
needed by xml2rfc but not provided by LyX: draftname, intended status,
and so on, as well as author metadata, and xml2rfc processing
instructions.

See the user guide for more information: lyx2rfc-user-guide (in this
same directory).

The user guide is itself written in LyX and rendered with xml2rfc as a
private document (i.e., not as an Internet-Draft, to avoid the I-D
boilerplate).

TODO:

 - Add iref support?
 - Add inline reference support?  bibxml works so well now...

BUGS:

 - LyX does not pass through any table column widths.  Besides, LyX lets
   the user set column widths only in centimeters, while xml2rfc allows
   only percentages.  Since the XSLT won't see any column width, there's
   nothing we can do.

   Still, we could add a custom inset by which to specify column widths
   in percentage and render that into xml2rfc's schema.
