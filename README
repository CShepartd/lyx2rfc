This is a project to make it possible to use LyX, a WYSIWYM[0] editor
based on LaTeX, to edit Internet-Drafts (and, if the RFC-Editor ever
wanted to, RFCs).

Currently the project is incomplete but very close to functional (i.e.,
it works with some manual intervention).  It consists of an XSLT 2.0
template to convert LyX XHTML output to the xml2rfc schema, at which
point one can run the xml2rfc tool to typeset in any of the normal
I-D/RFC formats (text, HTML, and PDF).

In order to use this one must add all the custom inset definitions from
the test-i-d.lyx file.  These custom insets are used to handle metadata
needed by xml2rfc but not provided by LyX (e.g., draftname, intended
status, and so on, as well as author metadata).

TODO:

 - Write a wrapper script to invoke lyx -e to export a LyX file to XHTML,
   pre-process the LyX XHTML output (e.g., to add entity definitions for
   &ldquo;, &rdquo; &ndash;, &nbsp;, and so on) invoke Saxon to apply
   the XSLT template, invoke xml2rfc.

 - Address XML namespace issues.

 - Complete cross-reference, external reference, and iref support.

 - Workaround LyX bug (fixed upstream) where the <a> anchors for
   bibliography entries are not output.  This will require a temporary
   convention in LyX I-D documents.
