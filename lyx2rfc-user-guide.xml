This is the user guide for lyx2rfc, a program for converting LyX documents into XML in the xml2rfc schema, then formatting to text and HTML via the xml2rfc and related tools. LyX is a graphical What You See Is What You Mean (WYSIWYM) editor.</t>

      <t>
Internet Requests For Comment (RFCs) are published by the RFC-Editor, typically on behalf of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The process involves a phase during which the RFC-to-be document is called an “Internet-Draft”.</t>
      <t>
Historically Internet-Drafts and RFCs have been kept as nroff documents and typeset with the nroff tool. In recent years nroff has been mostly replaced by a tool named xml2rfc <eref target="http://xml.resource.org/"/> that uses XML to represent the source to an Internet-Draft or RFC. See the guide to xml2rfc<eref target="http://xml.resource.org/authoring/draft-mrose-writing-rfcs.html"/>; see also <xref target="RFC2629"/>.</t>
      <t>
XML is a great step forward in user-friendliness – from nroff anyways. But XML is not really user-friendly unless used with XML editors. The lyx2rfc tool is intended to allow the use of LyX, a WYSIWYM graphical editor, for editing Internet-Drafts and RFCs.</t>
      <t>
This document itself, although it is not an Internet-Draft, much less an RFC, is written in LyX and rendered as text and HTML using lyx2rfc.</t>
    </section>
    <section title="Using LyX to Edit Internet-Drafts" anchor="sec_Using_LyX_to">
      <t>
The first step to using LyX to edit an Internet-Draft is to start LyX and then use Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;Local Layout to add the “custom insets” that lyx2rfc requires: just paste them in, click on Validate, then OK. Alternatively start by copying the 'test-i-d.lyx' sample Internet-Draft.</t>
      <section title="LyX Basics" anchor="sub_LyX_Basics">
        <t>
In the upper left hand corner of the LyX window there is a drop-down box for 'style' of text. 'Standard' here means 'paragraph'. Other styles include 'Title', 'Abstract', 'Section', etcetera. These correspond roughly to xml2rfc XML elements like 't', 'title', 'abstract', and 'section', but without any notion of elements containing elements.</t>
        <t>
For the rest, LyX is very similar to many WYSIWYG graphical editors.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Lyx2rfc Basics" anchor="sub_Lyx2rfc_Basics">
        <t>
While most xml2rfc input document elements can be mapped from existing LyX elements trivially, some xml2rfc elements have no LyX equivalents. To support these elements there are “custom insets” that are added via Document-&gt;Settings-&gt;Local Layout. To set XML Processing Instructions (“PIs”) simply write &lt;pi&gt;=&lt;value&gt;, use the mouse to select that text, then Insert-&gt;Custom Insets-&gt;PI. Several custom insets are provided as LyX equivalents of various xml2rfc elements not found natively in LyX.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Front Matter" anchor="sec_Front_Matter">
      <t>
All the front matter should be in the first page, although lyx2rfc does not actually require this.</t>
      <t>
The first line of the document should be set to the style of 'Title', then add a line below as 'Standard' where a number of custom insets will be added. A number of custom insets are REQUIRED:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="DocName">
 This corresponds to the Internet-Draft “handle” (e.g., draft-ietf-somewg-foobar-00).</t>
          <t hangText="TitleAbbrev">
 This is the abbreviation of the document title that is to appear at the bottom of every page (when formatted as text).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <t>
Other custom insets related to the document itself:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="IPR">
 This is the value of the 'ipr' attribute of the 'rfc' element (e.g., full3978).</t>
          <t hangText="IETFArea">
 The IETF area that this document is specific to (e.g., “Applications”).</t>
          <t hangText="IETFWorkingGroup">
 The IETF Working Group (WG) that this document is specific to (e.g., “TLS”).</t>
          <t hangText="IntendedStatus">
 The intended status for the RFC that would be published from the Internet-Draft, if it progresses that far (e.g., “Informational”).</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <section title="Typical PIs" anchor="sub_Typical_PIs">
        <t>
Add PI custom insets as desired for the desired PIs.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Author Metadata" anchor="sub_Author_Metadata">
        <t>
Open a line in 'Author' style for each author of the document and write the author's name, then add several custom insets for xml2rfc author metadata:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="AuthorRole">
 'author' or 'editor'.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorInitials">
 The author's initials (not including the surname).</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorSurname">
 The author's surname.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorOrg">
 The name of the author's organization (e.g., university or employer company name).</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorOrgAbbrev">
 The abbreviation of the author's organization for the front page of the rendered Internet-Draft/RFC.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorEmailAddr">
 The author's e-mail address</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorAddrStreet">
 The street portion of the author's postal address.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorAddrCity">
 The city portion of the author's postal address.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorAddrRegion">
 The region (state, province, ...) portion of the author's postal address.</t>
            <t hangText="AuthorAddrCountry">
 The country name portion of the author's postal address.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Abstract" anchor="sub_Abstract">
        <t>
Open a line below the last author line and style it 'Abstract'. Write your abstract. Use the enter key to start another abstract paragraph.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Middle Matter" anchor="sec_Middle_Matter">
      <t>
The meat of an Internet-Draft is organized into sections. Each section, sub-section, and sub-sub-section has a title. Open a line, style it 'Section', and write in the section title, then enter to start the contents of the section in 'Standard' (paragraph) style.</t>
      <section title="Subsections" anchor="d1e517">
        <t>
Open a line and set the style to “Subsection”.</t>
        <t>
NOTE: LyX allows subsections of no section: these are treated as subsections of section 0. lyx2rfc will ignore such subsections!</t>
        <section title="Sub-subsections" anchor="d1e529">
          <t>
Open a line and set the style to “SunSubsection”.</t>
          <t>
NOTE: LyX allows sub-subsections of no subsection: these are treated as sub-subsections of subsection 0. lyx2rfc will ignore such sub-subsections!</t>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section title="Paragraphs" anchor="sub_Paragraphs">
        <t>
You've seen paragraphs: they're just text in 'Standard' style.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Lists" anchor="sub_Lists">
        <t>
LyX supports all the sorts of lists that xml2rfc supports:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
numbered;</t>
            <t>
bulleted;</t>
            <t>
description lists;</t>
            <t>
nested lists.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
The lyx2rfc tool supports all of these.</t>
        <t>
Simply use in the obvious way.</t>
        <t>
Tip: use non-breaking spaces (Ctrl-Space) to embed spaces in the title of a description list entry, like so:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="Description list">
 A list where each list item has a title.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Figures" anchor="sub_Figures">
        <t>
Insert-&gt;Float-&gt;Figure, then left arrow, then Insert-&gt;Program Listing, then write/paste ASCII figure text. Don't forget to set the figure title.</t>
        <t>
For example:</t>
        <t>
</t>
        <t>
          <figure anchor="magicparlabel-150">
            <artwork>+=======+
| a box |
+=======+</artwork>
            <postamble>Figure 1:
Example figure
</postamble>
          </figure>
        </t>
      </section>
      <section title="Tables" anchor="sub_Tables">
        <t>
Click on the insert table icon in the toolbar and select the table form (NxM). You may want to enable the table toolbar as well.</t>
        <t>
For example:</t>
        <texttable>
          <ttcol align="center">
A</ttcol>
          <ttcol align="center">
2x2</ttcol>
          <ttcol align="center">
table</ttcol>
          <c>
...</c>
          <c>
...</c>
          <c>
...</c>
        </texttable>
      </section>
      <section title="Intra-Document Cross-References" anchor="sub_Intra_Document_Cross_References">
        <t>
Use Insert-&gt;Label... to insert a label at strategic places, such as:</t>
        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
in section titles</t>
            <t>
in figure titles</t>
            <t>
etcetera.</t>
          </list>
        </t>
        <t>
To reference a label use Insert-&gt;Cross-Reference...</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Citations" anchor="sub_Citations">
        <t>
To reference an RFC or Internet-Draft, or any bibxml item use the EntityXRef custom inset (Insert-&gt;Custom Insets-&gt;EntityXRef) and set the contents of the inset to be the anchor of the bibxml reference (the name that would have to be used as the 'target' attribute value in an xml2rfc 'xref' element). See  <xref target="sub_Adding__bibxml__References"/> for how to add references sections.</t>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section title="Back Matter" anchor="sec_Back_Matter">
      <t>
Back matter consists of:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
Author contact information, which is derived automatically from the author metadata custom insets as described in  <xref target="sub_Author_Metadata"/>;</t>
          <t>
Acknowledgements (not yet supported as back matter by lyx2rfc);</t>
          <t>
References sections;</t>
          <t>
Appendices.</t>
        </list>
      </t>
      <section title="References Sections" anchor="sub_References_Sections">
        <t>
To add a references section simply create a section titled “References”, “Normative References”, or “Informative References”.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Adding 'bibxml' References" anchor="sub_Adding__bibxml__References">
        <t>
xml2rfc can only handle references defined in its own particular schema. LyX's bibliography library support cannot trivially be mapped to/from the xml2rfc 'bibxml' library. Therefore lyx2rfc handles this by using LyX hyperlinks.</t>
        <t>
To add bibxml references just start a paragraph in a references section and then Insert-&gt;Hyperlink, setting the link target to the URL of a bibxml reference and the link text to any text that is suitable for use as the name of an XML entity. E.g., to add a reference to some RFC use 'rfcXXXX' as the link text and http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/reference.RFC.XXX.xml as the link target.</t>
      </section>
      <section title="Appendices" anchor="sub_Appendices">
        <t>
To add an appendix scroll to the end of your document, hit enter, then Document-&gt;Start Appendix Here, then select the style 'Section' to set the appendix title.</t>

    <section title="Running the lyx2rfc Tool" anchor="sec_Running_the_lyx2rfc">
      <t>
The lyx2rfc tool is a simple shell script that uses lyx(1) to export your LyX document as LyXHTML, then runs the Saxon XSLT processor to convert the document from the LyXHTML schema to the xml2rfc XML schema, then it applies xml2rfc and XSLT again to render as text and HTML.</t>

      <t>
lyx2rfc begins by invoking LyX to export the document into LyXHTML format. Then lyx2rfc applies an XSL sheel with the Saxon XSLT 2.0 processor to convert the LyXHTML intermediate form to XML in xml2rfc's schema. lyx2rfc then applies xml2rfc to obtain .txt and .unpg (unpaginated .txt) output. Finally, lyx2rfc applies Saxon with the Greenbytes XSL for converting xml2rfc documents to HTML.</t>
